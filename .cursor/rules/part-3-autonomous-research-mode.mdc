# Part 3 - Autonomous Research Mode Design Specification

## Overview

The Autonomous Research Mode is Part 3 of the MOTO Math Variant system. It is a self-directing two-tier research system that autonomously generates brainstorm topics, builds knowledge databases, and produces complete mathematical research papers based on a high-level research topic centered around the user prompt.

**Example User Prompt**: "Solve the Langlands Bridge problem" or "Advance understanding of the Riemann Hypothesis"

**Key Difference from Manual Modes**: 
- Part 1 (Aggregator) requires user-provided topic prompts
- Part 2 (Compiler) requires user-directed paper compilation prompts
- Part 3 (Autonomous Research) self-directs topic selection, brainstorming, and paper generation

**Two-Tier Architecture**:
- **Tier 1**: Brainstorm aggregation databases (mathematical concept exploration)
- **Tier 2**: Finished mathematical research papers (compiled from brainstorm databases)

## Design Philosophy

**Self-Directing Research**: The AI autonomously identifies the most valuable research avenues based on the high-level goal prompt.

**Basin Exploration**: Each brainstorm topic represents a "basin" of related mathematical concepts. The system explores each basin until sufficiently complete, then generates a paper.

**Cumulative Knowledge**: All brainstorm databases and papers persist, building a comprehensive research library over time.

**Model Weight Exploration**: Completion review uses SPECIAL SELF-VALIDATION MODE because only the same model can assess whether its own weights have been exhausted for a given topic.

**Internal Knowledge Only**: The autonomous system operates solely on the model's pre-trained mathematical knowledge, RAG context from prior work, and user prompt. No external data access.

---

## Integration Architecture

### Part 1 Aggregator Integration (Tier 1)
The autonomous coordinator USES actual Part 1 aggregator infrastructure for brainstorm aggregation:
- Creates separate `Coordinator` instance per brainstorm topic
- Configures with topic-specific database path (`data/auto_brainstorms/brainstorm_{topic_id}.txt`)
- Runs configurable 1-10 submitters + 1 validator workflow (default 3 submitters)
- Each submitter can have its own model, context window, and max output tokens for multi-model exploration
- SINGLE validator maintains coherent Markov chain evolution (same constraint as Part 1)
- Monitors acceptance count for completion triggers (every 10 acceptances)
- Handles pruning (every 7 acceptances) automatically via aggregator
- Uses global RAG lock to prevent collision with manual aggregator mode

**Implementation Details**:
- Temporarily overrides `system_config.shared_training_file` to point to brainstorm-specific database
- Calls `shared_training_memory.reload_insights_from_current_path()` after path change to prevent data loss (without reload, old insights from rag_shared_training.txt would overwrite brainstorm file)
- Sets WebSocket broadcaster to propagate aggregator events through autonomous coordinator
- Monitors aggregator stats in real-time to track acceptances/rejections
- Stops aggregator when completion review decides to write paper
- **Phase enforcement**: Construction submitter must check current phase before declaring completion
- **Premature decline rejection**: Coordinator rejects declines if required sections are missing based on current phase

### Part 2 Compiler Integration (Tier 2)
The autonomous coordinator USES actual Part 2 compiler infrastructure for paper compilation:
- Creates separate `CompilerCoordinator` instance per paper
- Configures with brainstorm database as primary source
- Adds reference papers (up to 6) to RAG context if selected
- Monitors compiler progress to detect abstract completion (final section)
- Extracts abstract from completed paper for metadata storage

**Critical Implementation Details**:
- Constrains section order: Body → Conclusion → Introduction → Abstract
- Paper is considered complete when abstract is detected in paper content
- Uses regex patterns to detect and extract abstract section
- Reference papers are RAG'ed with brainstorm having higher direct injection priority
- Outline is ALWAYS fully injected (never RAGed) for structural framework integrity

---

## Workflow Overview

**Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3 Loop:**
1. **Topic Selection** → Validator → Pre-Brainstorm Reference Selection (if papers exist)
2. **Brainstorm Aggregation** (1-10 submitters, 1 validator, pruning every 7, with reference papers)
3. **Completion Review** every 10 acceptances (SPECIAL SELF-VALIDATION) → Continue or Write Paper
4. If Write Paper: **Additional Reference Selection** → **Paper Title Selection** → **Paper Compilation** (Body→Conclusion→Introduction→Abstract)
5. **Paper Complete** → Log to Tier 2, cache brainstorm
6. **Paper Redundancy Review** every 3 papers
7. **Tier 3 Final Answer** every 5 papers (Certainty→Format→Short-form or Long-form volume)
8. Loop back to Topic Selection (or STOP if Tier 3 complete)

---

## STARTING POINT A: Topic Selection

### Purpose
The autonomous topic submitter decides what to work on next. It can:
1. **Generate a NEW topic**: Identify the next most valuable brainstorm avenue
2. **Continue an EXISTING topic**: Resume work on an incomplete brainstorm
3. **Combine EXISTING topics**: Merge multiple related brainstorms into a unified topic

### Topic Submitter Context
The submitter receives:
- User's high-level research prompt (PRIMARY context, always direct injected)
- List of all existing brainstorm topics with metadata:
  - Topic ID
  - Topic prompt/question
  - Status (in-progress / complete)
  - Submission count (acceptance count)
  - Last activity timestamp
- All completed Tier 2 papers with metadata:
  - Paper ID
  - Paper title
  - Abstract (full text)
  - Word count
  - Source brainstorm topic ID(s)
- Topic selection rejection history (last 5)

### Decision Criteria
When choosing between new / continue / combine:
- **New Topic**: When all existing topics are complete OR when a new mathematical avenue would provide more research value than continuing existing work
- **Continue Existing**: When an incomplete brainstorm has more value to explore before starting something new
- **Combine Topics**: When multiple existing brainstorms are related and would benefit from unified exploration

### JSON Schema

```json
{
  "action": "new_topic | continue_existing | combine_topics",
  "topic_id": "string - Required if action is continue_existing",
  "topic_ids": ["array of topic_ids - Required if action is combine_topics"],
  "topic_prompt": "string - Required if action is new_topic or combine_topics. The brainstorm question/avenue to explore",
  "reasoning": "string - Why this is the best choice right now"
}
```

### Example Output (New Topic)

```json
{
  "action": "new_topic",
  "topic_prompt": "Explore connections between modular forms and Galois representations in the context of the Langlands program",
  "reasoning": "The existing brainstorms have covered L-functions and automorphic representations. Modular forms provide a concrete computational entry point to the Langlands correspondence that hasn't been explored yet."
}
```

### Example Output (Continue Existing)

```json
{
  "action": "continue_existing",
  "topic_id": "topic_003",
  "reasoning": "The brainstorm on reciprocity laws has only 7 submissions and has not yet covered explicit formulas or computational approaches. Continuing this topic will provide more complete understanding before moving to a new avenue."
}
```

### Example Output (Combine Topics)

```json
{
  "action": "combine_topics",
  "topic_ids": ["topic_002", "topic_005"],
  "topic_prompt": "Unified exploration of local and global class field theory with applications to the Langlands program",
  "reasoning": "Topics 002 (local class field theory) and 005 (global reciprocity) are closely related and would benefit from unified treatment. Combining them will reveal deeper connections."
}
```

---

## Topic Validator

### Purpose
Validates the topic submitter's choice to ensure it represents the best use of research resources.

### Context
Receives the SAME context as the topic submitter:
- User's high-level research prompt
- All existing brainstorm topics with metadata
- All completed Tier 2 papers with metadata (title, abstract, word count, source)
- The topic submitter's proposed action

### Validation Criteria

**ACCEPT if**:
1. New topic addresses a genuinely valuable mathematical avenue not yet covered
2. Continue existing makes sense given the brainstorm's current state and mathematical depth
3. Combine topics is justified by genuine mathematical connections
4. Choice is relevant to the user's research goal
5. Reasoning is sound and mathematically grounded

**REJECT if**:
1. New topic duplicates an existing brainstorm
2. Continue existing on a brainstorm that should be marked complete
3. Combine topics lacks clear mathematical justification
4. Choice ignores more valuable research avenues
5. Reasoning is flawed or lacks mathematical rigor

### JSON Schema

```json
{
  "decision": "accept | reject",
  "reasoning": "string - Detailed explanation for the decision"
}
```

### Rejection Feedback
When rejected, the validator's reasoning is added to the topic submitter's rolling feedback cache (last 5 rejections), similar to aggregator submitter rejection logs.

**File**: `data/auto_research_topic_rejections.txt`

## Reference Paper Selection for Brainstorm (COMPOUNDING KNOWLEDGE)

### Purpose - The Crucial Mechanism for Compounding Knowledge

The autonomous research system's power comes from its ability to **compound knowledge across research cycles**. Each completed paper represents distilled mathematical insights that can inform and enhance future brainstorm explorations.

By selecting reference papers BEFORE brainstorming begins, submitters can:
- Build upon proven mathematical frameworks from prior papers
- Avoid re-exploring territory already covered in depth
- Identify novel connections between new topics and established results
- Accelerate convergence on valuable insights by standing on prior work

**This is the most crucial mechanism that allows database creativity to compound.**

### Workflow

**SKIP THIS STEP if no Tier 2 papers exist yet.**

After topic selection is validated, the reference selector:
1. Reviews ALL completed paper abstracts
2. Requests expansion of papers that would be VERY USEFUL for brainstorm exploration
3. Reviews full content of expanded papers
4. Selects up to 6 papers to use as context during brainstorming
5. Selected papers are loaded into brainstorm aggregator as `user_files`

### Why Outlines Are Included

**Design Principle:** Paper outlines are displayed alongside abstracts in all reference selection phases.

**Rationale - LLM Weight Activation:**
- Paper outlines contain structural information about the paper's organization
- Section headers, subsection names, and hierarchical structure activate relevant LLM weights
- This helps the model better assess topical relevance without reading full content
- Outlines provide "semantic anchors" that prime the model for recognizing connections
- The model can identify mathematical concepts, proof structures, and methodological approaches from the outline alone

**Display Format:**
```
--- Paper ID: paper_003 ---
Title: "Modular Forms and Galois Representations"
Abstract: "This paper explores the deep connections..."
Outline:
Abstract

I. Introduction
   A. Historical context
   B. Problem statement

II. Preliminaries
   A. Modular forms
   B. Galois representations

III. Main Results
   ...

Word Count: 8543
Source Brainstorms: topic_001
```

**Context Handling:**
- Outlines are fetched from `paper_{paper_id}_outline.txt`
- If outline is unavailable, displays "[Not available]"
- Outlines are included in BOTH abstract review (Step 1) AND full paper review (Step 2)

### Two-Step Browsing Workflow

**Step 1**: Review abstracts+outlines → Request expansion of promising papers  
**Step 2**: Review full content → Final selection (max 6 papers)

Context: Direct inject if fits (~40% budget), RAG if too large. No truncation.

---

### Context for Pre-Brainstorm Reference Selection
- User's high-level research prompt (direct injection)
- Current brainstorm topic prompt (direct injection)
- ALL Tier 2 paper titles + abstracts (direct injection if fits, RAG if too large)
- Instruction: "Select papers that would help inform and enhance exploration of this brainstorm topic"

---
Outline:
Abstract

I. Introduction
   A. Historical Context
   B. Problem Statement

II. Preliminaries
   A. Modular Forms
   B. Galois Representations

III. Main Results
   [...]

Word Count: 8543
Source Brainstorms: topic_001
```

The submitter reviews all abstracts and outlines, then decides which papers look promising enough to see in full. The submitter then requests expansion by providing paper IDs:

```json
{
  "expand_papers": ["paper_003", "paper_007", "paper_011"],
  "proceed_without_references": false,
  "reasoning": "Papers 003, 007, and 011 appear highly relevant based on their abstracts. Paper 003 covers modular forms which connects directly to our brainstorm on Galois representations. Papers 007 and 011 discuss automorphic forms and computational techniques respectively, both central to our upcoming exploration. Need to see full content to assess their utility for brainstorm context."
}
```

**Alternative - Proceed Without References:**

If no papers meet the "very useful" threshold, the submitter can skip reference selection:

```json
{
  "expand_papers": [],
  "proceed_without_references": true,
  "reasoning": "After reviewing all existing paper abstracts, none meet the 'very useful for brainstorming' threshold. The existing papers focus on different aspects of Langlands program (L-functions, reciprocity laws) that don't provide direct value for this specific brainstorm on modular forms and Galois representations."
}
```

**Step 2: Full Content Review Phase**

The reference selector shows the OUTLINE and FULL CONTENT of all requested papers:

```
============================================================
Paper ID: paper_003
Title: "Modular Forms and Galois Representations in the Langlands Program"
Word Count: 8543
============================================================

OUTLINE:
Abstract

I. Introduction
   A. Historical Context
   B. Problem Statement

II. Preliminaries and Definitions
   A. Modular forms and their properties
   B. Galois representations
   C. L-functions and automorphic forms

III. Main Results
   [...]

V. Conclusion

------------------------------------------------------------

FULL PAPER CONTENT:

Abstract

This paper explores the deep connections between modular forms...

I. Introduction

The Langlands program represents one of the most ambitious...

[... COMPLETE PAPER CONTENT ...]

V. Conclusion

We have established rigorous connections between...

============================================================
```

After reviewing the full content of all expanded papers, the submitter makes the final selection:

```json
{
  "selected_papers": ["paper_003", "paper_011"],
  "reasoning": "After reviewing full content, papers 003 and 011 provide the most useful reference material for brainstorm exploration. Paper 003 establishes the theoretical foundations for Galois representations we'll need to build upon. Paper 011's computational techniques will inform our exploration of concrete examples. Paper 007, while relevant, overlaps too much with our brainstorm topic and would be redundant during exploration."
}
```

**Context Handling (DIRECT INJECTION FIRST, RAG SECOND):**

- **Abstracts phase**: Always direct injected (small metadata - typically < 5000 tokens total)
- **Full papers phase**: 
  - If all papers fit in ~40% of context budget: Direct inject full content
  - If papers exceed context budget: RAG retrieves most relevant sections from each paper
  - Submitter ALWAYS sees either complete papers or highly-relevant RAG chunks
  - No truncation is ever used

**Key Features:**

- Submitter BROWSES abstracts before committing to see full papers
- Submitter CHOOSES which papers to expand (not automatic expansion of all papers)
- Submitter makes FINAL selection after reviewing full content
- System intelligently handles large papers via RAG when needed
- Maximum 6 papers enforced across both selection modes

### Context for Pre-Brainstorm Reference Selection
- User's high-level research prompt (direct injection)
- Current brainstorm topic prompt (direct injection)
- ALL Tier 2 paper titles + abstracts (direct injection if fits, RAG if too large)
- Instruction: "Select papers that would help inform and enhance exploration of this brainstorm topic"

### JSON Schema (Expansion Request)

```json
{
  "expand_papers": ["array of paper_ids to see full content"],
  "proceed_without_references": false,
  "reasoning": "string - Why these papers should be expanded OR why no papers meet threshold"
}
```

### JSON Schema (Final Selection)

```json
{
  "selected_papers": ["array of up to 6 paper_ids"],
  "reasoning": "string - Why these papers are very useful for brainstorm exploration"
}
```

### Key Design Points
- **Same references persist**: References selected here are used for BOTH brainstorming AND paper writing
- **Additional selection later**: AI can select MORE references (up to 6 total) before paper writing
- **No re-selection/removal**: Already-selected references remain selected throughout topic cycle

---

## Brainstorm Aggregation Runtime

Once a topic is validated and references selected, standard aggregation begins on that brainstorm topic.

### Architecture
- **3 Submitters**: Generate mathematical insights for the brainstorm topic
- **1 Validator**: Validates submissions (mathematical rigor, novelty, relevance)
- **Pruning**: Every 7 acceptances, cleanup review runs (same as Part 1)
- **Same as Part 1 Aggregator**: Uses identical submitter/validator patterns, RAG cycling, etc.
- **PARALLEL EXECUTION**: Submitters run in parallel regardless of boost status (boost is routing-only)

### Batch Validation (Inherited from Part 1)
The autonomous brainstorm aggregator inherits batch validation from Part 1 infrastructure:
- **Validator processes up to 3 submissions at once**: Uses batch-specific prompts for 1, 2, or 3 submissions
- **Independent assessment of each submission's value**: Each submission evaluated against existing database independently
- **Intra-batch redundancy prevention**: If multiple submissions would be accepted but are redundant with each other, only the strongest is accepted
- **Queue overflow handling**: If 10+ submissions queued, takes latest 3 and clears rest (older submissions were generated against outdated database state)
- **Accelerated brainstorm exploration**: Batch validation increases throughput while maintaining quality through redundancy checks

### Key Differences from Part 1 Aggregator
1. **Topic-Specific Database**: Writes to `data/auto_brainstorms/brainstorm_{topic_id}.txt` instead of `rag_shared_training.txt`
2. **No User-Provided Topic Prompt**: Uses the AI-generated brainstorm topic prompt
3. **Completion Tracking**: Tracks acceptance count (including removals) for completion review trigger
4. **Hard Limit**: 80 accepted submissions (FORCE transition to paper writing, no completion review)
   - Purpose: Prevents runaway brainstorms from accumulating indefinitely
   - Trigger: After each acceptance, check if count >= 80
   - Behavior: Immediately transition to paper writing, skip completion review
   - WebSocket event: `brainstorm_hard_limit_reached`
5. **Rejection Hard Limit**: 10 consecutive rejections (with minimum 5 acceptances) FORCE transition to paper writing
   - Purpose: Prevents infinite rejection loops when brainstorm is exhausted
   - Trigger: After rejection, check if consecutive rejections >= 10 AND acceptances >= 5
   - Behavior: Immediately transition to paper writing, skip completion review
   - WebSocket event: `brainstorm_rejection_limit_reached`

### Context for Submitters
- User's high-level research prompt (direct injection)
- Current brainstorm topic prompt (direct injection)
- **Selected reference papers (user_files - enables compounding knowledge)**
- Topic-specific database (RAG if large, direct injection if fits)
- Local rejection logs (per submitter, last 5)
- Completion feedback from prior completion reviews (last 5, topic-specific)

### Context for Validator
- User's high-level research prompt (direct injection)
- Current brainstorm topic prompt (direct injection)
- Topic-specific database (for REDUNDANCY check)
- Submission under review (direct injection if fits, RAG if large)

---

## Completion Review (SPECIAL SELF-VALIDATION MODE)

### Regular Trigger
Runs every 10 accepted submissions (includes both new acceptances AND pruning removals), AFTER the pruner has had its chance to run.

**Hard Limit Override**: If brainstorm reaches 80 accepted submissions, completion review is SKIPPED and paper writing is forced.

**Example trigger points**: 
- Acceptances at 10, 20, 30, 40... trigger completion review
- If prune removal happens at acceptance 9, the next acceptance (10th total) still triggers review
- At 80 acceptances: Hard limit triggers, completion review skipped, paper writing forced

### Manual Paper Writing Trigger (User Override)

**Purpose**: Allow user to act as special submitter reviewer and manually force transition to paper writing.

**Trigger**: User clicks "Force Paper Writing" button during active brainstorm (tier1_aggregation).

**Workflow**:
1. User sees current brainstorm progress (acceptance count, queue size, rejection count)
2. User decides brainstorm is ready for paper writing (based on their assessment)
3. User clicks "📝 Force Paper Writing" button in brainstorm status section
4. Confirmation dialog appears: "Confirm Force Paper Writing" / "Cancel"
5. On confirmation:
   - API endpoint `/api/auto-research/force-paper-writing` is called
   - Coordinator validates state (must be in tier1_aggregation)
   - Brainstorm aggregator is stopped immediately
   - Brainstorm is marked complete
   - System transitions to paper compilation workflow (Tier 2)

**API Endpoint**: `POST /api/auto-research/force-paper-writing`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Brainstorm topic_003 will now transition to paper writing",
  "topic_id": "topic_003",
  "topic_prompt": "Explore connections between modular forms...",
  "submission_count": 15
}
```

**Error Cases**:
- 400: Autonomous research not running
- 400: Not in tier1_aggregation (can only force during brainstorm)
- 400: No active brainstorm found
- 500: Transition failed

**WebSocket Event**: `manual_paper_writing_triggered`

**UI Location**: Within current brainstorm status section, appears only when tier1_aggregation is active

**Design Rationale**:
- User may have domain knowledge that brainstorm is sufficient before completion review interval
- Saves time when user knows brainstorm has explored enough territory
- Provides manual control over autonomous workflow
- User acts as "special submitter reviewer" deciding when to proceed

**Important Notes**:
- Does NOT run completion review (bypassed entirely)
- Does NOT require self-validation (user decision is final)
- Brainstorm is marked complete regardless of acceptance count
- Subsequent paper compilation proceeds normally with all selected reference papers

### Purpose
Assess whether the current brainstorm has been sufficiently explored relative to THIS MODEL'S internal knowledge (weights) and decide whether to continue brainstorming or begin writing a paper.

### Special Self-Validation Mode

**The submitter model MUST be its own validator for completion review.**

**Reasoning**: A different model cannot validate the weight-exploration assessment of another model because:
1. Each model has different training data and knowledge encoded in its weights
2. Model A cannot know what Model B "knows" or has exhausted
3. Only the same model can accurately assess whether its own knowledge basin is depleted for a brainstorm topic

**Implementation**:
- The completion review submitter generates an assessment
- The SAME model instance then validates its own assessment
- This is the ONLY place in the system where a submitter self-validates

### Completion Review Flow

1. **Submitter Assessment**: Model evaluates if it can think of anything extremely useful to add to the brainstorm
2. **Self-Validation**: Same model validates: "Is this assessment accurate? Is this brainstorm truly exhausted or ready for paper writing?"
3. **Decision**:
   - If CONTINUE_BRAINSTORM: Add feedback to rolling cache, return to aggregation
   - If WRITE_PAPER: Proceed to paper writing workflow (Tier 2)

### JSON Schema (Completion Submitter)

```json
{
  "decision": "continue_brainstorm | write_paper",
  "reasoning": "string - Detailed explanation of assessment",
  "suggested_additions": "string - If continue_brainstorm, what mathematical areas remain unexplored (optional)"
}
```

### JSON Schema (Self-Validation)

```json
{
  "validated": true | false,
  "reasoning": "string - Why the assessment is or isn't accurate"
}
```

### Completion Review Context
- User's high-level research prompt
- Current brainstorm topic prompt
- Full brainstorm database (all accepted submissions)
- Brainstorm metadata (submission count, duration, etc.)
- Prior completion feedback (last 5)

### Feedback on Non-Completion
If the decision is CONTINUE_BRAINSTORM, the `suggested_additions` field provides direction for future submissions. This feedback goes to a rolling cache (last 5) that is passed to the brainstorm aggregation submitters.

**File**: `data/auto_brainstorms/completion_feedback_{topic_id}.txt`

---

## Transition to Paper Writing

Once completion review decides WRITE_PAPER (and self-validates), the system transitions to paper writing workflow.

### Additional Reference Paper Selection (Pre-Paper Writing)

**Purpose**: Allow AI to select ADDITIONAL references discovered to be relevant during brainstorming.

**SKIP THIS STEP if**:
- No Tier 2 papers exist yet, OR
- Already at max capacity (6 papers selected during pre-brainstorm)

**Context**:
- Papers already selected for brainstorming (shown as "ALREADY SELECTED")
- ALL other paper abstracts (papers not yet selected)
- Completed brainstorm database (RAG) - provides insights from exploration

**Key Differences from Pre-Brainstorm Selection**:
- Shows which papers are ALREADY SELECTED (cannot be removed)
- Only shows papers NOT YET selected for expansion
- Maximum additional papers = 6 - (already selected count)
- Benefits from brainstorm insights to identify newly-relevant papers

### Two-Step Browsing Workflow (Additional Mode)

**Step 1: Abstract Review Phase (with Already-Selected Context)**

The reference selector shows the submitter which papers are already selected, then shows abstracts of remaining papers:

```
ALREADY SELECTED PAPERS (3 papers, 3 slots remaining):
  - paper_003: "Modular Forms and Galois Representations"
  - paper_007: "Automorphic Forms in the Langlands Program"
  - paper_011: "Computational Techniques for Modular Forms"

ADDITIONAL PAPERS AVAILABLE FOR SELECTION (can add up to 3 more):

--- Paper ID: paper_015 ---
Title: "Explicit Formulas in Class Field Theory"
Abstract: "This paper develops explicit computational formulas for class field theory constructions..."
Word Count: 7234
Source Brainstorms: topic_005

--- Paper ID: paper_018 ---
Title: "Baker's Theorem and Transcendence"
Abstract: "We present a comprehensive treatment of Baker's theorem on linear forms in logarithms..."
Word Count: 9120
Source Brainstorms: topic_007
```

The submitter reviews the brainstorm insights and decides if any additional papers would be valuable:

```json
{
  "expand_papers": ["paper_015"],
  "proceed_without_references": false,
  "reasoning": "During brainstorming, explicit computational techniques emerged as a key area. Paper 015 on explicit class field theory formulas would complement our existing references. Paper 018 on Baker's theorem is tangentially related but doesn't address the computational aspects we explored. Will review paper 015's full content before deciding."
}
```

**Alternative - Already-Selected Papers Sufficient:**

```json
{
  "expand_papers": [],
  "proceed_without_references": true,
  "reasoning": "The three papers already selected (modular forms, automorphic forms, computational techniques) provide comprehensive coverage for the paper we'll write. During brainstorming, we didn't identify any gaps that would require additional reference papers."
}
```

**Step 2: Full Content Review Phase (Additional Selection)**

The reference selector shows full content of requested papers:

```
============================================================
Paper ID: paper_015
Title: "Explicit Formulas in Class Field Theory"
Word Count: 7234
============================================================

[... COMPLETE PAPER CONTENT ...]
```

The submitter makes final selection of additional papers:

```json
{
  "selected_papers": ["paper_015"],
  "reasoning": "After reviewing full content, paper 015's explicit computational formulas align perfectly with the algorithmic approaches we developed during brainstorming. Adding this as 4th reference paper. Combined with our existing 3 papers, we now have comprehensive reference coverage."
}
```

**Final Result**: Already-selected (3) + newly-selected (1) = 4 total reference papers

**Step 1: Show Abstracts**

The submitter receives:
- User's high-level research prompt
- Current brainstorm topic prompt
- Completed brainstorm database (RAG)
- Papers ALREADY SELECTED (shown as list)
- REMAINING paper titles + abstracts (direct injection if fits, RAG if too large)
- Instruction: "Select ADDITIONAL papers based on insights from brainstorming"

**Step 1 JSON Schema**:

```json
{
  "expand_papers": ["array of paper_ids to see full content before deciding"],
  "proceed_without_references": false,
  "reasoning": "string - Why these papers should be expanded OR why already-selected papers are sufficient"
}
```

**If `proceed_without_references: true`**: Skip to Paper Title Selection (keep already-selected papers)

**Step 2: Show Full Papers (if expansion requested)**

The submitter receives:
- Same context as Step 1
- FULL CONTENT of all requested papers (RAG if needed)
- Instruction: "Make your final selection of ADDITIONAL papers. Already-selected papers will be kept."

**Step 2 JSON Schema**:

```json
{
  "selected_papers": ["array of additional paper_ids to add"],
  "reasoning": "string - Why these specific papers are valuable based on brainstorm insights"
}
```

**Validator Role**: 
- Topic validator reviews selection decisions
- Rejects if reasoning is unsound or selection doesn't align with brainstorm content
- Rejection feedback goes to rolling cache

**Final Reference List**: Already-selected papers + newly-selected papers (max 6 total)

### Paper Title Selection

**Context**:
- User's high-level research prompt
- Current brainstorm database (RAG)
- Selected reference papers (if any, RAG)
- ALL existing paper titles from THIS brainstorm topic (direct injection)
- ALL existing paper abstracts from THIS brainstorm topic (if any, direct injection)

**Purpose**: Choose a title for the paper that will be compiled from this brainstorm.

**JSON Schema**:

```json
{
  "paper_title": "string - The complete title for the mathematical research paper",
  "reasoning": "string - Why this title appropriately captures the brainstorm content and differentiates from existing papers (if any)"
}
```

**DISTINCTION FOR TITLE VALIDATION:**

| Concept | Definition | Validation Behavior |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| **Brainstorm Submissions** | Raw research insights in "BRAINSTORM SUMMARY" - the SOURCE MATERIAL for the paper | Title SHOULD reflect this content - that's expected! DO NOT reject for similarity to brainstorm submissions |
| **Existing Papers from Brainstorm** | Previously completed Tier 2 papers listed in "EXISTING PAPERS FROM THIS BRAINSTORM" | ONLY reject if title is too similar to these existing papers |

**Key Points:**
- If "EXISTING PAPERS FROM THIS BRAINSTORM: None" → Nothing to differentiate from, accept if other criteria met
- Title similarity to brainstorm content is CORRECT (captures source material)
- Title similarity to existing papers is a rejection reason (creates redundancy)

**Validator Role**:
- Topic validator reviews title selection
- Rejects if title is too similar to **EXISTING COMPLETED PAPERS** from this brainstorm (NOT brainstorm submissions!)
- Rejects if title doesn't align with brainstorm content
- DO NOT reject simply because title reflects brainstorm submission content - that is INTENDED behavior
- Rejection feedback goes to rolling cache

---

## Tier 2 - Paper Compilation

Once paper title is selected and validated, paper compilation begins using the FULL Part 2 compiler workflow.

### Compilation Workflow

**Uses existing Part 2 (Compiler) infrastructure**:
- Sequential Markov chain workflow
- High-context submitter (outline, construction, review modes)
- High-parameter submitter (rigor mode)
- Compiler validator (coherence, rigor, placement validation)
- **Iterative outline creation** (submitter refines outline until satisfied or 15 iteration limit)

**Sequential Writing Order**

Unlike manual Part 2 mode (which writes "next best section"), autonomous mode writes sections in this SPECIFIC ORDER:

1. **Outline Creation + Validation** (iterative refinement with validator feedback, max 15 iterations)
2. **Body Sections** (write all body sections following outline order)
3. **Conclusion** (write conclusion section)
4. **Introduction** (write introduction section)
5. **Abstract** (write abstract - FINAL section)

**Paper Completion Condition**: Paper is considered COMPLETE when the abstract is written AND validated by the compiler validator.

**REQUIRED SECTION STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)**:
All outlines MUST include these exact sections with these exact names:

| Section | Exact Name | Required | Position |
|---------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Abstract | "Abstract" | YES | First in outline/paper |
| Introduction | "Introduction" or "I. Introduction" | YES | After Abstract |
| Body | Flexible (II., III., etc.) | YES (at least 1) | Between Intro and Conclusion |
| Conclusion | "Conclusion" or "N. Conclusion" | YES | Last content section |

The validator will REJECT any outline missing these required sections or with incorrect section names.

### Compiler Cycle Behavior

**Full Part 2 cycle is used** (construction → outline_update → review → review → rigor), BUT with constrained section selection:

**During Body Section Phase**:
- Construction mode: Write next body section following outline order
- Cannot skip to conclusion/introduction/abstract

**Critique Phase (Post-Body, Pre-Conclusion)**:
- **Maximum Rewrites**: 1 completed rewrite allowed. Rewrite counts as "completed" only after first successful body acceptance. After 1 completed rewrite, critique phase is skipped.
- **Pre-Critique Snapshot**: Paper body snapshotted at critique phase start (for rewrite context)
- **Triggered**: Automatically when body construction completes (unless rewrite_count >= 1 completed rewrites)
- **Purpose**: Peer review body section before proceeding to conclusion
- **Target**: 5 total attempts (accepted + rejected + declined)
- **Decline Mechanism**: Submitter can assess "no critique needed" if body is academically acceptable (no mathematical errors, all outline requirements met, proper rigor)
- **Skip Rewrite**: If 5 total attempts complete with 0 accepted critiques, skip rewrite phase and continue to conclusion
- **Rewrite Decision**: If 5 total attempts reached with ≥1 acceptance, submitter decides: continue / partial_revision / total_rewrite
- **Decision Options**:
  - **CONTINUE**: Critiques minor/incorrect, proceed to conclusion
  - **PARTIAL_REVISION**: **ITERATIVE** edits - proposes ONE edit at a time, validates, applies, sees result, then proposes next. Context includes pre-critique paper + current paper + accepted critiques.
  - **TOTAL_REWRITE**: Clear entire body and rebuild from scratch (catastrophic flaws only). Receives pre-critique paper + accepted critiques for context.
- **Accumulated History**: All critiques from all previous failed versions are provided to rewrite decision
- **Context for Rewrites**: Pre-critique paper (shows what failed) + accepted critiques ONLY (rejected critiques NOT included)
- **JSON Schema**: `{"critique_needed": true/false, "submission": "...", "reasoning": "..."}` for critiques; `{"decision": "continue|partial_revision|total_rewrite", "new_title": null, "new_outline": null, "reasoning": "..."}` for rewrite decision (note: edit_operations removed, now iterative)

**Skip Critique Phase (User Override)**:
- **Purpose**: Allow users to manually skip the critique/rewrite phase and proceed directly to conclusion
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/auto-research/skip-critique`
- **Availability**: Only during Tier 2 paper writing when actively in critique phase
- **Behavior**: Immediately ends critique phase, transitions to conclusion phase, broadcasts `critique_phase_skipped` with `reason: "user_override"`
- **Cannot be undone**: Once executed, critique phase for current paper version is permanently skipped
- **Frontend**: "Skip Critique & Continue" button appears in paper status banner during critique phase (requires confirmation)
- **Error Conditions**: 400 if not running, 400 if not in Tier 2 paper writing, 400 if not in critique phase

**Outline Updates**: Outline can be updated at any time during the cycle (same as Part 2)

**Review/Rigor**: These modes operate normally throughout all phases

**Section Order Enforcement Mechanism (EXPLICIT COMPLETION SIGNALS)**:
- Compiler operates in "autonomous mode" with phase tracking via `autonomous_section_phase`
- Phase transitions triggered by EXPLICIT `section_complete: true` signals from submitter JSON
- Each phase has a dedicated prompt function: `get_body_construction_system_prompt()`, `get_conclusion_construction_system_prompt()`, `get_introduction_construction_system_prompt()`, `get_abstract_construction_system_prompt()`
- Submitter sets `section_complete: true` when current phase is done, coordinator advances to next phase
- Replaces unreliable regex-based detection with explicit completion signals
- Paper is complete when abstract phase receives `section_complete: true`
- Abstract phase always sets section_complete=true when submitting abstract content - writing abstract completes the paper
- Phase tracking prevents premature section writing (e.g., cannot write abstract until introduction phase complete)

### Context Priority

**Direct Injection Priority**:
1. User's high-level research prompt (ALWAYS direct)
2. Paper title (ALWAYS direct)
3. Current outline (ALWAYS fully direct - never RAGed)
4. Current paper progress (direct if fits, RAG if large)
5. Brainstorm database (direct if fits, RAG if large)
6. Referenced papers (RAG)

**RAG Offload Priority** (when content doesn't fit):
1. Referenced papers → RAG FIRST
2. Brainstorm database → RAG SECOND
3. Current paper progress → RAG LAST (only if extremely large)

**Note**: Outline is always fully injected (never RAGed) for structural framework integrity.

### Autonomous RAG Manager Implementation

The autonomous RAG manager follows the same "no truncation" principle as Part 1 and Part 2. Content that doesn't fit in available context is offloaded to RAG semantic search, never truncated.

**Context Handling Methods**:

1. **`get_brainstorm_context(topic_id, max_tokens)`**:
   - Direct injects if brainstorm database fits within max_tokens
   - Falls back to RAG retrieval if exceeds budget
   - Returns tuple: (context_text, used_rag_fallback: bool)

2. **`get_reference_papers_context(paper_ids, max_tokens_per_paper)`**:
   - ALWAYS uses RAG retrieval for reference papers
   - Retrieves most relevant chunks from each paper
   - No direct injection for reference papers (too large)

3. **`prepare_compiler_context(topic_id, reference_paper_ids, outline, paper, context_budget)`**:
   - Calculates budget allocation respecting priority order
   - Direct injects outline (non-negotiable, no budget check)
   - Direct injects brainstorm if fits, else RAG retrieval
   - RAG retrieves reference papers (always)
   - Direct injects current paper if fits after all above, else RAG retrieval

**Prompt Size Validation** (all autonomous agents):
- Topic selector: validates prompt size before LLM call
- Topic validator: validates prompt size before LLM call
- Completion reviewer: validates prompt size for both assessment and self-validation
- Reference selector: validates prompt size for abstract review and expansion requests
- Paper title selector: validates prompt size before LLM call
- Returns None if prompt exceeds context window (triggers retry or error handling)

**Error Handling**:
- If prompt size exceeds context window even with full RAG offloading → raise ValueError with diagnostic info
- If RAG retrieval fails → log error, return empty string (allows workflow to continue)
- If content too large even for RAG → compress (preserves entities, removes redundancy)

### Rejection Feedback

Compiler validator rejections are logged to:
- `data/auto_papers/paper_{paper_id}_last_10_rejections.txt`
- Follows same structure as Part 2 compiler rejection logs

---

## Tier 2 - Paper Completion Handling

### Paper Finalization

When abstract is written and validated, the paper is considered COMPLETE. Additionally, if the system switches to a new topic before abstract completion, the current paper is automatically saved.

**Actions on Completion**:

1. **Save Final Paper**:
   - File: `data/auto_papers/paper_{paper_id}.txt`
   - Contains: Full paper with all sections

2. **Save Outline**:
   - File: `data/auto_papers/paper_{paper_id}_outline.txt`
   - Contains: Paper outline for structural reference

3. **Extract and Save Abstract**:
   - File: `data/auto_papers/paper_{paper_id}_abstract.txt`
   - Contains: Abstract text only

4. **Cache Brainstorm Database**:
   - File: `data/auto_papers/paper_{paper_id}_source_brainstorm.txt`
   - Contains: Complete brainstorm database that sourced this paper

5. **Update Metadata**:
   - File: `data/auto_research_metadata.json`
   - Add paper entry with:
     - paper_id
     - paper_title
     - abstract (full text)
     - word_count
     - source_brainstorm_id(s)
     - creation_timestamp
     - status: "complete"

5. **Update Statistics**:
   - Increment total_papers_completed
   - Track papers per brainstorm
   - Track average word counts

6. **Auto-Generate Critique** (background task):
   - Automatically generates validator critique for every completed Tier 2 paper
   - Uses validator model from current session configuration
   - Calculates average rating: `(novelty + correctness + impact) / 3`
   - Saves critique to paper's critique storage
   - If average rating ≥ 7.0, emits `high_score_critique` WebSocket event
   - Frontend displays popup notification (max 3, FIFO queue)
   - Non-blocking: errors logged but don't affect paper completion
   - See "Auto-Critique Popup Notifications" section below for details

### Paper Redundancy Review

**Trigger**: Every 3 completed papers (total_papers_completed % 3 == 0)

**Purpose**: Maintain quality of paper library by identifying redundant papers.

**Tier 3 Protection**: Paper redundancy checks are disabled when Tier 3 is active (`_tier3_active = True`). This prevents accidentally purging papers that are being used in the final volume. The flag is set at the start of `_tier3_final_answer_workflow()` and reset in the finally block.

**Workflow**:

1. **Validator Review**:
   - Context: ALL paper titles + abstracts (direct injection)
   - User's high-level research prompt
   - Instruction: "Review all papers and determine if ANY ONE paper should be REMOVED due to redundancy"

2. **JSON Schema**:

```json
{
  "should_remove": true | false,
  "paper_id": "string - The paper_id to remove (or null if should_remove is false)",
  "reasoning": "string - Detailed explanation of why this paper should be removed OR why no removal is needed"
}
```

3. **Removal Criteria**:
   - Paper is REDUNDANT with other papers (content fully covered elsewhere)
   - Paper was MARGINALLY useful but other papers provide better coverage
   - Paper's unique contributions are minimal compared to other papers

4. **Conservative Approach**:
   - When in doubt, DO NOT remove
   - Only remove if CERTAIN the library would be better without it
   - Maximum 1 removal per review cycle

5. **Execution**:
   - If removal validated: Move paper to `data/auto_papers/archive/`
   - Update metadata to mark as "archived"
   - Update statistics

### Return to Topic Selection

After paper completion (and redundancy review if triggered), the workflow checks if **Tier 3 Final Answer** should trigger.

---

## Tier 3 - Final Answer Generation

### Overview

Tier 3 synthesizes all accumulated research (Tier 2 papers) into a **final answer** to the user's original research prompt. This tier triggers every 5 completed papers and produces either:
- **Short Form**: A single comprehensive paper directly answering the user's question
- **Long Form**: A curated volume/collection of papers with Introduction and Conclusion papers

### Key Design Principles

1. **Context Isolation**: Tier 3 operates ONLY on Tier 2 papers, NOT on Tier 1 brainstorm databases
2. **Independent Rejection Feedback**: Tier 3 has its own 10-rejection cache, separate from Tiers 1/2
3. **System Termination**: Once the final answer is complete, the autonomous system stops
4. **Modular Code Reuse**: Uses existing Tier 2 paper writing infrastructure (no duplicate code)

### Trigger Condition

- **Every 5 papers in library**: Triggers when `actual_library_count - last_check >= 5`
- Based on actual papers saved in the paper library, not internal counters
- Uses `paper_library.count_papers()["active"]` to get the true count
- Example trigger points: 5, 10, 15, 20 papers in library

### Phase 1: Certainty Assessment

**Purpose**: Assess what can be answered WITH CERTAINTY from existing research papers.

**Two-Step Paper Browsing** (same pattern as reference selection):

1. **Abstract Review Phase**:
   - Show all paper titles + abstracts + outlines
   - AI requests expansion of relevant papers

2. **Full Content Review Phase**:
   - Show full content of expanded papers
   - AI assesses "known certainties"

**Certainty Levels**:
| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `total_answer` | User's question can be FULLY answered with high confidence |
| `partial_answer` | Question can be partially answered with certainty |
| `no_answer_known` | Existing research doesn't provide an answer - MORE RESEARCH NEEDED |
| `appears_impossible` | The question appears mathematically impossible |
| `other` | Special cases |

**JSON Schema (Certainty Assessment)**:
```json
{
  "certainty_level": "total_answer | partial_answer | no_answer_known | appears_impossible | other",
  "known_certainties_summary": "string - Detailed summary of what is established with certainty",
  "reasoning": "string - Why this certainty level was chosen"
}
```

**Special Case - `no_answer_known`**:
- If certainty assessment returns `no_answer_known`, Tier 3 exits
- System returns to normal research (Topic Selection)
- More papers will be generated before next Tier 3 trigger

**Validation**: Topic validator reviews certainty assessment (10-rejection feedback loop)

### Phase 2: Format Selection

**Purpose**: Select the format for the final answer based on certainty assessment.

**Format Options**:

| Format | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `short_form` | Answer can be presented coherently in single paper |
| `long_form` | Answer requires curated collection, multiple perspectives |

**Decision Factors**:
- Complexity of user's question
- Number and diversity of relevant papers
- Whether single coherent narrative is possible
- Whether papers naturally form a cohesive volume

**JSON Schema (Format Selection)**:
```json
{
  "answer_format": "short_form | long_form",
  "reasoning": "string - Why this format is appropriate"
}
```

**Validation**: Topic validator reviews format selection (10-rejection feedback loop)

### Phase 3A: Short Form Answer

**Workflow**:

1. **Reference Selection**: Browse all papers, select up to 6 for direct injection
2. **Title Selection**: Title that directly answers user's prompt (uses existing `PaperTitleSelectorAgent`)
3. **Paper Compilation**: Use existing Tier 2 compiler infrastructure
   - Outline creation → Body → Conclusion → Introduction → Abstract
   - Context: Selected reference papers (NO brainstorm databases - Tier 3 context isolation)
4. **System Stops**: After abstract is written, autonomous research terminates

**Paper Title Requirement**: Title must DIRECTLY and TRANSPARENTLY answer the user's question.

**JSON Schema (Final Paper Title)**:
```json
{
  "paper_title": "string - Title that directly answers the user's question",
  "reasoning": "string - Why this title appropriately answers the question"
}
```

### Phase 3B: Long Form Answer (Volume)

**Volume Organization Workflow** (iterative refinement like outline creation):

1. **Initial Organization**:
   - AI selects which existing papers become body chapters
   - AI identifies "gap papers" that need to be written
   - AI creates volume structure with title and chapter order

2. **Validation Loop**:
   - Validator reviews volume organization
   - If rejected, AI refines organization
   - Continues until `outline_complete=true` AND validator accepts (max 15 iterations)

**Chapter Types**:
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `existing_paper` | Existing Tier 2 paper used as-is |
| `gap_paper` | New paper to be written to fill content gap |
| `introduction` | Introduction paper (frames the volume, written LAST) |
| `conclusion` | Conclusion paper (synthesizes findings, written second-to-last) |

**JSON Schema (Volume Organization)**:
```json
{
  "volume_title": "string - Title of the complete volume",
  "chapters": [
    {
      "chapter_type": "existing_paper | gap_paper | introduction | conclusion",
      "paper_id": "string or null",
      "title": "string",
      "order": "number (1-based)",
      "description": "string - Brief description of chapter content"
    }
  ],
  "outline_complete": true | false,
  "reasoning": "string - Why this organization effectively answers the question"
}
```

**Paper Writing Order (Long Form)**:
1. **Gap Papers** (if any): Write in chapter order
2. **Conclusion Paper**: Synthesizes all chapters, directly answers user's question
3. **Introduction Paper**: Frames the volume, provides roadmap (written LAST)

**Volume Assembly**: After all chapters are written:
- Papers are combined into final volume
- Displayed in "FINAL ANSWER" section of GUI
- System stops after Introduction paper abstract is written

### Model Tracking and Attribution

The system implements **two tiers of model tracking**:
1. **Per-Paper Tracking**: Tracks API calls for each individual paper (Tier 1 brainstorm + Tier 2 compilation)
2. **Global Tier 3 Tracking**: Tracks all API calls during final answer generation

#### Per-Paper Model Tracking

**Purpose**: Each paper includes author attribution showing which AI models were used to create it.

**Tracking Mechanism (Autonomous Mode - Part 3)**:
- When brainstorm aggregation starts, a `PaperModelTracker` is initialized
- A callback is set on `api_client_manager` that tracks every API call to the per-paper tracker
- Same model used in multiple instances counts as ONE author, but all API calls are tallied
- Model usage is stored in `PaperMetadata.model_usage` (Dict[str, int] mapping model_id to call count)
- When Tier 3 is active, API calls are tracked to BOTH the per-paper tracker AND the global Tier 3 tracker

**Tracking Mechanism (Manual Mode - Part 2)**:
- When compiler initializes (not in autonomous mode), a `PaperModelTracker` is initialized
- A callback is set on `api_client_manager` that tracks every API call during compilation
- Model tracking data is included when saving the paper via `/api/compiler/save-paper`
- No reference papers section in manual mode (manual mode doesn't have reference papers)

**Per-Paper Author Attribution Section** (at beginning of each paper):
```

AUTONOMOUS AI SOLUTION

Disclaimer: This is an autonomous AI solution generated with the MOTO harness.
This paper was not peer reviewed and was autonomously generated without user
oversight or interaction beyond the original user prompt, therefore, this text
may contain errors. These papers often contain ambitious content and/or
extraordinary claims, all content should be viewed with extreme scrutiny.

User's Research Prompt: [user's original prompt here]

- Qwen-2.5 (1)

Generated: 2026-01-02
================================================================================
```

**Reference Paper Models Section**:
- Lists models from all reference papers used in creating this paper
- Models are listed **alphabetically** (case-insensitive)
- If a model appears in multiple reference papers, count is shown: `ModelName (N)`
- If a model appears in only one reference paper, no count is shown: `ModelName`
- Helps track the complete lineage of AI contributions to each paper
- Omitted for papers with no reference papers

**Per-Paper Model Credits Section** (at end of each paper):
```
================================================================================
MODEL CREDITS

This autonomous solution attempt was generated with the Intrafere LLC AI Harness,
MOTO, and the following model(s):

- deepseek-r1:70b (85 API calls)
- qwen-2.5:32b (23 API calls)

Total AI Model API Calls: 108

Wolfram Alpha Verifications: 3 queries
================================================================================
```

**Wolfram Alpha Verification Tracking**:
- Wolfram Alpha API calls are tracked separately from LLM API calls
- Only ACCEPTED Wolfram verifications are counted (where result was added to paper via validated rigor submission)
- Displayed in MODEL CREDITS section below LLM model list
- Format: "Wolfram Alpha Verifications: N queries"
- Tracking happens in `compiler_coordinator._submit_and_validate_rigor()` after validator acceptance
- If no Wolfram calls made, this line is omitted from credits
- **Graceful edge case handling**: Credits show even if only Wolfram calls exist (no model tracking data), or if only model calls exist (no Wolfram calls)

**PaperMetadata Model Updates**:
```python
class PaperMetadata(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...
    model_usage: Optional[Dict[str, int]] = None  # model_id -> API call count
    generation_date: Optional[datetime] = None    # When paper was generated
    wolfram_calls: Optional[int] = None           # Wolfram Alpha verification count
```

**PaperModelTracker Class** (`backend/autonomous/memory/paper_model_tracker.py`):
- `track_call(model_id)`: Record an API call for a model
- `track_wolfram_call(query)`: Record a Wolfram Alpha verification
- `get_wolfram_call_count()`: Get total Wolfram queries
- `has_tracking_data()`: Returns True if any model calls OR Wolfram calls exist (handles edge cases gracefully)
- `get_models_dict()`: Get Dict[str, int] for metadata storage
- `get_author_list()`: Get list of unique model IDs
- `generate_author_attribution(...)`: Generate header text with reference models
- `generate_model_credits()`: Generate footer text (includes Wolfram count if >0, handles edge case of Wolfram-only credits)
- `generate_credits_for_existing_paper(model_usage, wolfram_calls)`: Includes Wolfram count for saved papers, gracefully handles missing model_usage
- `aggregate_reference_models(paper_usages)`: Aggregate models from reference papers
- `format_reference_models(models_dict)`: Format alphabetically with duplicate counts

#### Global Tier 3 Model Tracking

Tier 3 tracks all models used during final answer generation for author attribution and model credits.

**Tracking Mechanism**:
- When Tier 3 starts, model usage tracking is initialized via `final_answer_memory.initialize_model_tracking(user_prompt)`
- A callback is set on `api_client_manager` that tracks every API call made during Tier 3
- Same model used in multiple instances counts as ONE author, but all API calls are tallied
- Tracking is automatically disabled when Tier 3 completes or fails
- Per-paper tracking also occurs during Tier 3 for gap/intro/conclusion papers

**Author Attribution Section** (at beginning of final answer):
```

AUTONOMOUS AI SOLUTION

This was an autonomous AI solution generated with the MOTO harness.

User's Research Prompt: [user's original prompt here]

AI Model Authors: deepseek-r1:70b, qwen-2.5:32b, llama-3.1:70b

================================================================================
```

**Model Credits Section** (at end of final answer):
```
================================================================================
MODEL CREDITS

This autonomous solution attempt was generated with the Intrafere LLC AI Harness,
MOTO, and the following model(s):

- deepseek-r1:70b (127 API calls)
- qwen-2.5:32b (43 API calls)
- llama-3.1:70b (18 API calls)

Total API Calls: 188
================================================================================
```

**Key Design Points**:
- Author section lists unique model IDs WITHOUT call counts
- Credits section lists models WITH call counts, sorted by usage (descending)
- Mid-generation volumes without tracking data gracefully skip these sections
- Models used in parallel instances are counted as single author entries
- Tracking includes all API calls: certainty assessment, format selection, volume organization, paper writing
- Per-paper tracking runs SIMULTANEOUSLY with Tier 3 tracking for papers written during Tier 3

### Tier 3 Data Persistence

**Directory**: `data/auto_final_answer/` (or `auto_sessions/{session_id}/final_answer/`)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `final_answer_state.json` | Current Tier 3 state (for crash recovery), includes `model_usage` tracking |
| `volume_organization.json` | Volume structure (long form) |
| `tier3_rejections.txt` | Tier 3 rejection log (last 10, INDEPENDENT from Tiers 1/2) |
| `chapter_{index}_paper.txt` | Gap/intro/conclusion papers |
| `chapter_{index}_outline.txt` | Chapter outlines |
| `final_volume.txt` | Assembled volume (long form) with author attribution and model credits |
| `final_short_form_paper.txt` | Short form final answer with author attribution and model credits |
| **`source_papers/`** | **NEW: Archived copies of all Tier 2 papers used in final answer** |
| **`source_papers/paper_{id}.txt`** | **Paper content** |
| **`source_papers/paper_{id}_abstract.txt`** | **Paper abstract** |
| **`source_papers/paper_{id}_outline.txt`** | **Paper outline** |
| **`source_papers/paper_{id}_metadata.json`** | **Paper metadata** |
| **`source_brainstorms/`** | **NEW: Archived copies of all Tier 1 brainstorms that sourced those papers** |
| **`source_brainstorms/brainstorm_{id}.txt`** | **Brainstorm database** |
| **`source_brainstorms/brainstorm_{id}_metadata.json`** | **Brainstorm metadata** |

### Research Lineage Archival

When Tier 3 assembles a final answer (short-form or long-form), the system automatically archives the complete research lineage:

1. **Paper Archival**: All Tier 2 papers referenced in the final answer are copied to `source_papers/`:
   - Short-form: Copies all papers from `short_form_reference_papers` list
   - Long-form: Copies all papers from `existing_paper` chapters in volume organization
   - Includes: paper content, abstract, outline, and metadata

2. **Brainstorm Archival**: All Tier 1 brainstorms that sourced those papers are copied to `source_brainstorms/`:
   - Extracted from each paper's `source_brainstorm_ids` metadata field
   - Automatically deduplicates (same brainstorm may source multiple papers)
   - Includes: brainstorm database and metadata

3. **Archive Statistics**: Logged at INFO level:
   - Number of papers archived
   - Number of brainstorms archived
   - List of paper IDs and brainstorm IDs

**Purpose**: Ensures the entire research journey from initial brainstorm → papers → final answer is preserved together for complete provenance and reproducibility.

**Timing**: Archival happens BEFORE the final volume/paper is saved, ensuring consistency if the process crashes.

**Access**: Archived resources are read-only copies. Deleting a paper from the main library does NOT affect archived copies in completed final answers.

  - Click brainstorm → view full database content in read-only format
  - Clear "ARCHIVED - READ ONLY" badge
  - Back button to return to list

**API Endpoints**:
- `GET /auto-research/final-answer/{answer_id}/archive/papers` - List archived papers
- `GET /auto-research/final-answer/{answer_id}/archive/papers/{paper_id}` - Get paper details
- `GET /auto-research/final-answer/{answer_id}/archive/brainstorms` - List archived brainstorms
- `GET /auto-research/final-answer/{answer_id}/archive/brainstorms/{topic_id}` - Get brainstorm details

**Design Principles**:
- Non-intrusive: Button is discrete, not prominently displayed
- Familiar interface: Looks similar to live BrainstormList/PaperLibrary components
- Read-only: Clear visual indicators (badges, no action buttons)
- Complete lineage: Shows entire research journey from brainstorms → papers → final answer

### Tier 3 Critical Invariants

1. **Tier 3 papers do NOT use brainstorm databases** - Only reference Tier 2 papers
2. **Tier 3 rejection log is independent** - Separate from Tiers 1/2
3. **System stops after final answer** - No more paper generation
4. **Volume papers use standard Tier 2 compiler** - No duplicate paper-writing code
5. **Crash recovery preserves Tier 3 state** - Can resume from any phase

---

**The autonomous research cycle continues until Tier 3 produces a final answer and the system stops, OR until user manually stops the autonomous research mode.**

---

## Data Persistence

### Brainstorm Databases

**File Pattern**: `data/auto_brainstorms/brainstorm_{topic_id}.txt`

Each brainstorm has its own database file containing accepted submissions, formatted identically to Part 1's `rag_shared_training.txt`.

**Metadata File**: `data/auto_brainstorms/brainstorm_{topic_id}_metadata.json`

```json
{
  "topic_id": "topic_001",
  "topic_prompt": "Explore connections between modular forms and Galois representations",
  "status": "complete",
  "submission_count": 23,
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "completed_at": "2025-01-15T12:45:00Z",
  "last_activity": "2025-01-15T12:45:00Z",
  "papers_generated": ["paper_001", "paper_005"]
}
```

### Paper Files

**File Pattern**: `data/auto_papers/paper_{paper_id}.txt`

Contains full paper content.

**Abstract File**: `data/auto_papers/paper_{paper_id}_abstract.txt`

Contains abstract only.

**Source Brainstorm Cache**: `data/auto_papers/paper_{paper_id}_source_brainstorm.txt`

Contains complete brainstorm database that sourced this paper.

### Research Metadata File

**File**: `data/auto_research_metadata.json`

```

### Workflow State File (Crash Recovery / Resume)

**File**: `data/auto_workflow_state.json`

This file persists the current workflow state to enable **automatic resume** after program restart or crash. The system automatically saves this state at key checkpoints:

- After topic selection (starting brainstorm aggregation)
- Periodically during brainstorm aggregation (every 5 acceptances)
- When transitioning to paper compilation
- During paper writing phases
- **During Tier 3 final answer generation phases**

On **clean stop** (user-initiated via stop button), this file is automatically cleared.

On **restart/crash recovery**, if this file exists with `is_running: true`, the system detects an interrupted workflow and:
1. Restores internal state (topic ID, acceptance counts, model config, etc.)
2. Automatically resumes from the last known phase
3. Broadcasts `auto_research_resumed` WebSocket event


**Important Notes:**
- The user research prompt is saved in `auto_research_metadata.json`, not the workflow state
- Model configuration is saved to allow resuming with the same model settings
- If the workflow state file is corrupted or missing, the system starts fresh
- The `clear_all_data` API endpoint clears the workflow state along with all other data

---

## Session-Based Folder Organization

### Overview
Each autonomous research session gets its own folder organized by the user's research prompt. This enables:
- Easy navigation of past research sessions
- Automatic data organization by topic
- Crash recovery per-session
- Export and archival of complete research sets

```
```

### Session ID Format
- Sanitized prompt (first 50 chars, special chars replaced with underscores)
- Timestamp suffix: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM`
- Example: `solve_langlands_bridge_2025-01-15_14-30`

### SessionManager Class (`backend/autonomous/memory/session_manager.py`)
Singleton that manages session folder organization:
- `initialize(user_prompt)`: Creates new session folder
- `resume_session(session_id)`: Resumes existing session
- `get_brainstorms_dir()`: Returns path to brainstorms subdirectory
- `get_papers_dir()`: Returns path to papers subdirectory  
- `get_final_answer_dir()`: Returns path to final_answer subdirectory
- `list_all_sessions()`: Lists all sessions with metadata

### Memory Module Integration
All memory modules (`brainstorm_memory`, `paper_library`, `final_answer_memory`, `research_metadata`) support session-based paths via `set_session_manager()`:
- When session manager is set, paths resolve to session subdirectories
- Enables complete data isolation between sessions
- Backward compatible with legacy flat structure

### Dual-Path Storage Architecture

The autonomous research system maintains backward compatibility through a dual-path architecture:

**Legacy Paths (backward compatibility):**
```
backend/data/auto_brainstorms/      # Brainstorm databases
backend/data/auto_papers/           # Completed papers  
backend/data/auto_final_answer/     # Final answer files
```

**Session-Based Paths (preferred for new sessions):**
```
backend/data/auto_sessions/{session_id}/brainstorms/     # Session brainstorms
backend/data/auto_sessions/{session_id}/papers/          # Session papers
backend/data/auto_sessions/{session_id}/final_answer/    # Session final answers
```

**Path Resolution Priority:**
1. Check for active session via `session_manager`
2. If session active: use session-based paths
3. If no session: fall back to legacy paths
4. Memory modules handle path resolution automatically

**Critique Storage Integration:**
- Critiques are stored in `.critiques/` subdirectory within each paper's directory
- `critique_memory.py` accepts `base_path` parameter for session-awareness
- When paper is deleted, critiques are automatically cleaned up from correct location
- Path is derived from `paper_library.get_paper_path(paper_id)` which returns session-aware paths

**Important for New Features:**
- Always use memory module methods (e.g., `paper_library.get_paper_path()`) to get paths
- Never hardcode paths like `data/auto_papers/` directly
- Pass resolved paths to any persistence layer that needs session awareness
- Config paths (`system_config.auto_papers_dir`, etc.) are legacy-only references

## Force Tier 3 Manual Override

### Overview
Users can force the transition to Tier 3 final answer generation at any time during autonomous research (when at least 1 paper exists). This provides manual control over when to synthesize results.

### Trigger Conditions
- Autonomous research must be running
- At least 1 completed paper must exist
- Not already in Tier 3 final answer generation

### Two Modes

**complete_current**: Complete current work first, then trigger Tier 3
- If in Tier 1 (brainstorm): Forces paper writing completion, then Tier 3
- If in Tier 2 (paper writing): Waits for current paper to complete, then Tier 3

**skip_incomplete**: Skip incomplete work, proceed with completed papers only
- **Stops main loop FIRST** (`_running = False`, `_stop_event.set()`) to prevent race conditions
- Stops current aggregator/compiler unconditionally (without checking tier state)
- Marks incomplete brainstorm as "complete" (schema doesn't support "abandoned")
- **Resets execution flags for Tier 3** (`_running=True`, `_stop_event.clear()`) - allows chapter writing and paper compilation loops to run
- **Runs Tier 3 synchronously** - no background task, returns result directly
- **Resets flags back to stopped state after completion** (`_running=False`, `_stop_event.set()`)
- Triggers Tier 3 with whatever papers are already complete

## Integration Notes

### Relationship to Part 1 (Aggregator)
- Part 3 USES Part 1's aggregator infrastructure for Tier 1 brainstorm aggregation
- Same configurable 1-10 submitters + 1 validator architecture (default 3 submitters)
- Each submitter can have its own model, context window, and max output tokens
- Single validator maintains coherent Markov chain evolution
- Same pruning mechanism (every 7 acceptances)
- Same RAG cycling for submitters (256 → 512 → 768 → 1024)
- Same rejection feedback mechanisms
- **DIFFERENCE**: AI-generated topic prompts instead of user-provided prompts

### Relationship to Part 2 (Compiler)
- Part 3 USES Part 2's compiler infrastructure for Tier 2 paper compilation
- Same sequential Markov chain workflow
- Same high-context + high-parameter submitter architecture
- Same outline/construction/review/rigor modes
- Same validator with coherence/rigor/placement checking
- **DIFFERENCES**: 
  - Constrained section order (body → conclusion → intro → abstract)
  - AI-generated paper titles instead of user-provided prompts
  - Reference paper selection workflow
  - Brainstorm database as primary source

### Running Modes
- **Part 1, Part 2, Part 3 can run INDEPENDENTLY** (user chooses which mode)
- **Part 1 and Part 2 can run SIMULTANEOUSLY** (as originally designed)
- **Part 3 runs ALONE** (it internally uses Part 1 and Part 2 components but manages them autonomously)
- User cannot manually start Part 1 or Part 2 while Part 3 is running (Part 3 controls them)

---

## Prerequisites

- At least one LM Studio model must be available for each role
- User must provide high-level research prompt
- No dependency on prior Part 1 or Part 2 usage
- Fresh start with empty brainstorm/paper libraries

---

## Error Handling

### JSON Parse Failure (Topic Selection)
- Retry up to 3 times with same context
- If persistent, log error and retry with refreshed context (include prior failure in context)

### JSON Parse Failure (Brainstorm Aggregation)
- Same as Part 1 Aggregator: reject submission, feedback to submitter

### JSON Parse Failure (Paper Compilation)
- Same as Part 2 Compiler: reject submission, feedback to submitter

### Model Timeout
- 90 second timeout for topic selection
- 60 second timeout for brainstorm aggregation submissions
- 90 second timeout for paper compilation submissions
- On timeout, retry once then log and continue

### Completion Review Failure
- If self-validation fails to parse, treat as "continue_brainstorm"
- Log error and continue brainstorm aggregation

### Paper Compilation Failure
- Paper compilation is retried indefinitely until success or user stops - no skipping allowed
- A completed brainstorm ALWAYS produces a paper; the system never abandons a brainstorm without writing its paper
- Title selection retries indefinitely with rejection feedback threaded into each attempt

---

## Configuration Defaults

### Autonomous Research Mode
- Brainstorm submitter context window: 131072 tokens
- Validator context window: 131072 tokens
- High-context submitter context window: 131072 tokens
- High-parameter submitter context window: 131072 tokens
- Brainstorm submitter max tokens: 25000
- Validator max tokens: 25000
- High-context submitter max tokens: 25000
- High-parameter submitter max tokens: 25000
- Completion review interval: 10 acceptances (includes removals)
- Topic selection retry limit: 3
- Max brainstorms in parallel: 1 (sequential brainstorm → paper cycle)
- Max reference papers for context: 6

---

## Critical Invariants

1. **User research prompt is ALWAYS direct injected** - Non-negotiable in all operations
2. **Brainstorm database is ALWAYS saved with its produced paper** - Full cache for provenance
3. **Outline is ALWAYS fully injected during paper compilation** - Never RAGed, structural framework integrity
4. **Topic selection can ALWAYS choose to continue an existing brainstorm** - Not forced to create new topics
5. **Paper is NOT complete until abstract is written AND validated** - Sequential order must complete
6. **Same model MUST self-validate completion review decisions** - SPECIAL SELF-VALIDATION MODE
7. **Completion review counts both acceptances and removals** - Pruning counts toward 10-acceptance trigger
8. **Maximum 6 reference papers total** - Context budget constraint (applies to brainstorm AND paper writing)
9. **Paper section order is FIXED**: Body → Conclusion → Introduction → Abstract - Cannot skip or reorder
10. **Paper redundancy review is CONSERVATIVE** - Maximum 1 removal per cycle, when in doubt keep
11. **Workflow state is ALWAYS persisted for crash recovery** - System auto-resumes from last checkpoint on restart
12. **Reference papers selected before brainstorm PERSIST through topic cycle** - Same papers used for brainstorming AND paper writing, enabling compounding knowledge
13. **Tier 3 papers do NOT use brainstorm databases** - Only reference Tier 2 completed papers (context isolation)
14. **Tier 3 has INDEPENDENT rejection feedback** - Separate 10-rejection cache from Tiers 1/2
15. **System STOPS after final answer is complete** - No more paper generation after Tier 3 completes
16. **Tier 3 triggers every 5 papers IN THE LIBRARY** - Based on actual `paper_library.count_papers()["active"]`, not internal counters
17. **`no_answer_known` exits Tier 3** - Returns to normal research, more papers needed
18. **Long-form volume writing order is FIXED** - Gap papers → Conclusion → Introduction (last)
19. **Model tracking is ENABLED during Tier 3** - All API calls tracked for author attribution and model credits
20. **Same model = single author** - Model used in multiple instances counts as ONE author entry, but all API calls tallied
21. **Paper redundancy is DISABLED during Tier 3** - `_tier3_active` flag prevents redundancy checks from purging papers being used in the final volume
22. **Brainstorm hard limit is 80 acceptances** - After 80 acceptances, paper writing is forced (no completion review)
23. **Maximum 1 completed rewrite per paper** - Rewrite counts as "completed" only after first successful body acceptance; prevents infinite loops from failed rewrite attempts
24. **Partial revision option available** - Allows targeted edits without full body rewrite
25. **Total rewrite is last resort** - Only for catastrophic issues that can't be fixed with targeted edits
26. **Rejection hard limit is 10 consecutive rejections (with 5+ acceptances)** - Prevents infinite rejection loops

## Comparison: Manual Modes vs Autonomous Mode

| Aspect | Part 1 (Aggregator) | Part 2 (Compiler) | Part 3 (Autonomous Research) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Topic Source | User provides prompt | User provides prompt | AI generates topics |
| Database | Single shared DB | Outline + paper | Per-brainstorm DBs + paper library |
| Completion | User stops manually | User stops manually | AI determines completion OR Tier 3 completes |
| Paper Generation | N/A | User-directed compilation | AI-directed compilation |
| Section Order | N/A | Next best section | Fixed: Body→Concl→Intro→Abstract |
| Running | Independent | Independent | Autonomous (controls Part 1 & 2) |
| Final Answer | N/A | N/A | Tier 3: Short-form paper OR Long-form volume |
| System Termination | N/A | N/A | Tier 3 completion stops entire system |

## Model Selection and Context Notes

**All model selections and context windows are user-configurable via GUI settings** (same as Part 1 and Part 2).

### OpenRouter Integration

Each role in autonomous research mode supports OpenRouter model selection with host/provider choice:

**Per-Role Configuration** (for each brainstorm submitter, validator, high-context, high-param, critique submitter):
- **Provider Toggle**: "Use OpenRouter" button switches role to OpenRouter model selection
- **OpenRouter Model Selector**: When OpenRouter enabled, dropdown shows available OpenRouter models
- **Provider/Host Selector**: Specific provider selection (e.g., "Anthropic", "Google AI", "AWS Bedrock") or "Default (OpenRouter chooses)"
- **LM Studio Fallback**: Optional fallback model if OpenRouter fails (credit exhaustion, errors)

**Fallback Behavior**:
- If OpenRouter is selected and has a fallback configured: Automatically falls back to LM Studio on credit exhaustion
- If no LM Studio available: OpenRouter-only operation (system works without LM Studio)
- Fallback is per-role and permanent for the session (no retries after fallback)

## Other Notes

Special Self-validation mode: The SPECIAL SELF-VALIDATION MODE for completion review is critical to the system's integrity. Do not attempt to use a different model for completion validation, as this would compromise the accuracy of the "knowledge exhaustion" assessment.

Out-of-order paper writing: The sequential paper writing order (body → conclusion → intro → abstract) is designed to ensure the paper has substantive content before writing the introduction (which previews the content) and abstract (which summarizes the content). This order produces more coherent papers than writing introduction-first.

**JSON Response Handling**:
- All LLM responses preprocessed by `sanitize_json_response()` in `backend/shared/json_parser.py`
- Handles reasoning tokens (`<think>...</think>`), markdown wrappers, control tokens
- Extracts first complete JSON object when multiple present
- Handles LaTeX escape sequences comprehensively: fixes invalid `\u{word}` patterns, fixes invalid `\uXXXX` non-hex escapes, **pre-escapes dangerous LaTeX commands BEFORE any json.loads() attempt** (prevents `\to` becoming tab+o, `\text` becoming tab+ext, etc.) - dangerous commands include `\to`, `\text`, `\textbf`, `\times`, `\top`, `\tau`, `\theta`, `\triangle`, `\frac`, `\forall`, `\beta`, `\bar`, `\big*`, `\begin`, `\nu`, `\nabla`, `\neq`, `\not*`, `\rho`, `\right*`, `\rightarrow`, `\Rightarrow`, `\upsilon`, `\underline`, `\uparrow`
- Agent-level array handling for models that return arrays instead of objects
